## Description

The purpose of my website is to serve as a planning tool for both daily tasks and long term tasks. I incorporated features that would make it easier for people to navigate everything they have to do everyday. This website, therefore, relies heavily on user input. The target audience of this website consists of students and young-adults who lead very busy lives, so the overall visual design was decided upon to bring a calming but still vibrant setting to their lives. 

On the dashboard, users can view their three closest deadlines that have yet to be completed. A deadline will be highlighted if it is very close (within three days). This is meant to keep the user on track and initiate a call to action. There is also a space for the user to jot down notes. The last aspect of this dashboard is the to-do list where users can add shorter term tasks, check them off, or completely remove them. A progress bar with a percent is displayed to show much of the to-do list is finished with a clear visual and numerical cue. 

On the kanban board, users can organize their long term tasks. They can add tasks into any of the three stages of the kanban board. Then, they can drag and drop the tasks around to move them from one stage to another. Similar to on the dashboard, very close and still unfinished deadlines are highlighted and a progress bar is displayed. Users can also delete tasks from the kanban once they are no longer needed. 

By making it easy for a user to track their progress and see reminders, this application hopes to better motivate people to finish their plans and organize their time, hence the name: motivately.
